# About the PyData Paris Conference

<a id="mission"></a>
## Mission

PyData conferences are a gathering of users and developers of data
analysis tools in Python. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts
a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to
apply the language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast
realm of data management, processing, analytics, and
visualization.

We aim to be an accessible, community-driven conference, with
tutorials for novices, advanced topical workshops for practitioners,
and opportunities for package developers and users to meet in
person.

A major goal of PyData events and conferences is to provide a venue
for users across all the various domains of data analysis to share
their ex- periences and their techniques, as well as highlight the
triumphs and potential pitfalls of using Python for certain kinds of
problems.


PyData Paris 2015 is organized by <a href="http://www.systematic-paris-region.org/">Systematic Paris
Region</a>,
with the generous help and support of <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>
and our sponsors. If you would like to
volunteer to be a part of the PyData Paris team, contact us at: <a href="mailto:pydata@joinux.org">pydata@joinux.org</a>

The first PyData Workshop was held in March of 2012, at the Googleplex in Mountain View, CA. Many prominent individuals in the Python data & scientific computing community were on-hand to deliver tutorials and how-to presentations, and the Workshop (and a Friday night hack-a-thon) were a great success. Unfortunately, we had a very limited amount of space, and were unable to provide a spot for everyone who wanted to come.

In light of the demand and the success of that event, we reserved a much larger venue for PyData NYC. The conference sold out and was a great success.

"It was so successful that even Hurricane Sandy tried to attend!"

In order to continue the growth of PyData we need to continue to charge a modest registration fee to cover conference costs. It also means that we have a greater need for commercial sponsors, so please contact us at admin@pydata.org if you want to have your company highlighted in front of hundreds of data science & data analysis Pythonistas!
