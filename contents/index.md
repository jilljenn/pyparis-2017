## Attending PyParis 2017

### What's PyParis 2017?

PyParis 2017 will be the first gathering of Python developers and
business users in Paris, covering a large range of Python-related topics:

- **PyData**: data science, machine learning, AI, NoSQL, simulation,
  business analytics, data visualisation, scientific computing, etc.
- **Cloud & Apps**: web & mobile frameworks, devops, etc.
- **Core language**: the Python language and its core ecosystem (tools & libraries),
  how it's evolving and how to best leverage new features in the language
- **Python in education**: experience reports from and outside the french education system

See [the CFP](/cfp.html) for more information about the program.

### Why attend?

By attending PyParis 2017, you will:

* **Learn** about the leading Python frameworks, libraries and toolkit,
   directly from their lead developers and from experts.
* Get to know, ahead of the curve, the **emerging research and
  industrial projects** that will shape the Python ecosystem tomorrow.
* Understand **how to apply** Python tools and techniques to concrete
  problems, from business strategy to the nitty gritty details that are
  often overlooked.
* **Network** with your peers, make new connections, foster new collaborations.

### Program

We will have a dense program with **four keynotes** and **around 50 talks and roundtables** in
**four parallel tracks**.

See [the CFP](/cfp.html) for more information.

### Associated event(s)

There is going to be a **Scikit-Learn development sprint**. This sprint
is organised by the Scikit-Learn core
development team and has a limited number of seats available. Please get in
touch with them (via their mailing list) if you are interested in joining the
sprint.

### Venue and tickets

PyParis 2017 takes place in Paris la Défense at Pole Universitaire
Léonard de Vinci (PULV), a venue with enough capacity for **400 attendees**.

Price for tickets will be **120 Euros**, with **discounts** for early birds,
students, academics and bootstrapped startups.

Our event is non-profit. All proceeds from the ticket sales will be used
to make the best event possible for the benefit of the Python community.
